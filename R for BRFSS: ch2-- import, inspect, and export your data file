#the file may not be found. solution -> delete the file extension and rewrite
>LLCP2020 <- import("LLCP2020.XPT")
#read the file 
>LLCP2020
#too much information, just read the headings  in a horizontal way, or you can read the heading in a vertical way like the way in line 20, these are the variables' names
>head(LLCP2020)
#to see the structure, like how they collect the data, 
#for the first line, state == the state of their first survey, 1 == the code
>str(LLCP2020)
#look at the tail
#the last line you can see the how many results of their survey, there are 401,958 observations in this survey
>tail(LLCP2020)
#read the head in a vertical way
>glimpse(LLCP2020)
#display column names
>colnames(LLCP2020)
#or
>names(LLCP2020)
#to export the data, this will be exported as an excel file
>export(LLCP2020,"LLCP2020.csv")
#blank spaces in excel == missing data, some optional questions states can decide to or not to answer
