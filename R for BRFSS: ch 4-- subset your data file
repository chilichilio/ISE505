#"BRFSS Modules Used by State". this file includes the information about addtional modules adopted by diffenrent states
#to drop those modules without answers for a specific state, take California for example
#step1: filter data only for California state, since the state number == 6
> ca2017 = filter(llcp2017,X_STATE == 6)

#'data.frame':	9358 obs. of  358 variables:
#this means 9358 observations taken in this state
#to know how many missing data cells in each module
>colSums(is.na(ca2017))
#this will return how many missing data points in each column

#to know if nobody answered in any column
>colSums(is.na(llcp2017)) == 9358
#this will return the "TRUE" or "FALSE" if the above condition is true
#or without the exact number
>colSums(is.na(ca2017)) == nrow(ca2017)

#to find out those 100% missing data columns and show them on the screen
which(colSums(is.na(ca2017)) == nrow(ca2017))
#all the columns with 100% missing data will show on the screen, with its name and corresponding column number
#assign these 100% missing data columns to a variable, later to drop
drop_var = which(colSums(is.na(ca2017)) == nrow(ca2017))
#show these drop_var from ca2017, to look at its structure, assign these data to a variable
>a = ca2017[,drop_var]
>str(a)
#can use glimpse(a) to check the frame

#to get the data without these missing data columns
>ca2017drop_var = ca2017[,-drop_var]
